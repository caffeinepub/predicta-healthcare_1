REQ-23 appears implemented by adding an ImageGallery component and wiring new Hospital Furniture and Laboratory Setup gallery sections into ProductsPage. However, the diff summary does not show the required static image files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated with the exact filenames, so the asset-addition part of REQ-21 is not evidenced.",
